# Health — steward snapshot

_Last run: 2026-07-14 (steward, daily health). Overwritten each run; latest state only._

## Status counts (19 features)
- ✅ **shipped:** 16 — 001–010, 012–017 (all merged, #16–#29)
- 🤔 **proposed (your go/no-go):** 1 — 011 (search, scope is the open question)
- 📥 **ready (builder's queue):** 1 — 018 (Finance tab, gated behind 019 by design)
- 🚧 **blocked (needs you):** 1 — 019 (Plaid→Chase sync; 4-table migration + Plaid account/env vars)
- 🏗 building / 💬 discussing / 👀 preview / 🔁 iterating: 0

**Waiting on you:** 2 (011 proposal + 019 unblock). **In flight:** 0. **Queued for builder:** 1.

## Fixed this run
- Nothing to fix. Re-audited `LEARNINGS.md` (no dead refs, no dupes, no contradictions —
  same six file references still resolve). Re-verified all 19 backlog folders have
  `spec.md` + `log.md`, all `Status:`/`Class:` values valid, all agree with `gh pr list`.
  Since yesterday's steward run (fe89969), three quiet builder passes landed
  (#2–#4 on 2026-07-14), each touching doc-only files (dashboard + dispatch log) —
  zero app code, zero folder/status changes. Board is fully static. Refreshed the
  dashboard "Last run" line only.

## Needs John

### Standing (unchanged from yesterday's run)

- **011 search — 37 days untouched** (intake 2026-06-07, still only the original
  entry in `log.md`). Re-triage flag, not auto-close. Reply "go" for a Phase-1
  pitch (docs/notes search), narrow scope, or park another cycle.

- **018 and 019 — 33 days since last `log.md` activity** (2026-06-11). Not neglect —
  both are actively blocked on the same known prerequisite (019 needs the Plaid
  account + 4-table migration; 018 is gated behind 019 by design). No new
  information this run; flagging continues per the stale-item rule.

- **[Draft PR #13](https://github.com/j0hnegan/today/pull/13) "Native iOS app shell (Capacitor) [WIP]"**
  (`feat/ios-capacitor`) — **44 days open** (since 2026-05-31). No backlog folder. Three options:
  1. **Track it** — create a backlog folder seeded from the PR description.
  2. **Park it** — minimal folder, `status: blocked` (needs Xcode/signing to proceed).
  3. **Close it** — close the PR if on indefinite hold.
  (Note: the working tree currently has an untracked `ios/` build-artifact
  folder that correlates with this branch — left untouched, it's app code.)

- **`feature/task-triage-v2`** — local branch, 1 commit (2026-06-21), no PR filed, no backlog folder. Options: file a PR, create a backlog folder via `/backlog`, or merge/close if it was a one-off.

- **`origin/claude/fix-task-categorization-j8nuy`** — old bug-fix branch (~74 days, 2026-05-01), 1 commit ahead of main, no PR ever filed. Check whether `feature/task-triage-v2` addresses this; if so, close the branch.

- **019 Plaid→Chase sync stays blocked** — needs 4-table migration + Plaid account + env vars. 018 Finance tab queued right behind it.

## Healthy
- All 19 folders have `spec.md` + `log.md`. All `Status:`/`Class:` values valid.
- Every `Status:` agrees with GitHub: #16–#29 merged → shipped; 011/018/019 have no branch/PR → consistent.
- Dashboard ↔ folders are 1:1 (001–019). No orphans.
- LEARNINGS.md clean — no contradictions, no dead refs, no dupes. Unchanged since 2026-06-10.
- Nothing `building`/`discussing` → no builder race.
- Active features last touched: 011 (37 days — flagged above), 018 (33 days), 019 (33 days).

## Cleanup candidates (not the steward's to delete)
- Local branches `claude/wonderful-einstein`, `claude/wonderful-goodall`, `ios-app` — zero commits ahead of main, safe to delete. `feat/responsive-mobile` shows 1 commit by hash not on main (upstream gone), previously verified: content is fully redundant (squash-merged as PR #12; the lone remaining commit's fix is already present on main byte-for-byte) — safe to delete.
- Remote branch `origin/claude/task-duplication-bug-Mrona` — previously verified: 0 commits ahead of main, fully merged. Safe to delete.
- Remote stale `origin/auto/005-step2b-code`, `origin/auto/014-carryover-empty-guard` — PRs merged, harmless leftovers.
- Untracked `ios/` folder in working tree — Capacitor build artifact from `feat/ios-capacitor`.
